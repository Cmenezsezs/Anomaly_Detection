Anomaly Detection on Time Series Data using Python
This script uses the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in time series data. Isolation Forest is an unsupervised learning algorithm that identifies data points that are farthest from the rest of the data.

Required Libraries
7. pandas for data manipulation and analysis
2. numpy for numerical computations
3. scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
4. matplotlib for data visualization
